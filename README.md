A telecom company (Vodafone) wants to find out the likelihood of a customer leaving the company. This project aims to build a classification model that predicts if a customer will churn or not.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use Supervised Machine Learning (classification) Machine Learning to explore the significance of churn analytics as a strategic tool for telecommunication companies to proactively identify potential risk factors for churn, optimize retention efforts, and cultivate lasting customer relationships. The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to explore and analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network service.

The churn analytics predictive model is a data-driven solution designed to address the persistent challenge of customer churn in subscription-based industries. This model aims to identify customers at risk of churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures and implement targeted retention strategies.
